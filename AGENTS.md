# Project Instructions

## Agent Architecture

This project uses four specialized agents:

```text
USER
  ↓
ARCHITECT
  ↓
PLANNER
  ↓
DEVELOPER
  ↓
TESTER
  ↓
PLANNER
  ↓
ARCHITECT
  ↓
USER
```

The Architect is the only agent that communicates directly with the user.

The user should not need to communicate directly with Planner, Developer, or Tester.

Each agent has a clearly defined responsibility.

Agents must not silently assume responsibilities belonging to another agent.

---

# Context Architecture

Persistent project knowledge is stored under:

```text
docs/context/
```

The project context is divided into six specialized documents.

```text
context/
├── requirements.md
├── architecture.md
├── decisions.md
├── implementation.md
├── testing.md
└── status.md
```

Each context has one primary responsibility.

```text
WHAT
→ requirements.md

HOW
→ architecture.md

WHY
→ decisions.md

HOW TO EXECUTE
→ implementation.md

HOW TO VALIDATE
→ testing.md

WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW
→ status.md
```

Never use one context file as a substitute for another.

---

# Context Ownership

```text
ARCHITECT
├── requirements.md
├── architecture.md
└── decisions.md

PLANNER
├── implementation.md
└── status.md

TESTER
└── testing.md
```

Agents may read context owned by other agents when required.

Only the designated owner should modify a context file.

If information belongs to another context:

1. Do not place it in the current context.
2. Identify the correct owner.
3. Escalate or delegate appropriately.

---

# Context Persistence Rules

Persist information only when it has future value.

Before writing to a context file, determine:

1. Is this information useful beyond the current task?
2. Which context owns this information?
3. Does the information already exist?
4. Would writing it create duplication?
5. Is this the correct level of detail?

Do not persist:

* Temporary reasoning.
* Intermediate thoughts.
* Full conversation history.
* Large logs.
* Redundant information.
* Routine execution output.

---

# Context Access

Use progressive context loading.

Do not load all context files by default.

## Architect

Primary:

```text
requirements.md
architecture.md
decisions.md
```

Secondary when required:

```text
implementation.md
testing.md
status.md
```

## Planner

Primary:

```text
requirements.md
architecture.md
implementation.md
status.md
```

Secondary when required:

```text
decisions.md
testing.md
```

## Developer

Primary:

```text
architecture.md
implementation.md
```

Secondary when required:

```text
requirements.md
decisions.md
status.md
```

## Tester

Primary:

```text
requirements.md
testing.md
```

Secondary when required:

```text
architecture.md
implementation.md
decisions.md
status.md
```

"Primary" does not mean the entire file must always be loaded.

Read only the relevant sections.

---

# Agent Communication

Agents communicate through concise, structured information.

Do not reproduce entire previous messages.

Do not pass unnecessary context.

Pass only information required for the next action.

Communication flow:

```text
Architect → Planner
    Requirements
    Architecture
    Constraints
    Acceptance criteria

Planner → Developer
    Focused implementation task
    Relevant files
    Relevant constraints
    Expected behavior

Developer → Planner
    Implementation result
    Changed files
    Diagnostics
    Blockers

Planner → Tester
    Requirements
    Acceptance criteria
    Changed behavior
    Relevant test scenarios

Tester → Planner
    Validation result
    Evidence
    Failure classification
    Limitations

Planner → Architect
    Execution summary
    Validation summary
    Blockers
    Architectural concerns
```

---

# Delegation Rules

The Architect delegates execution planning to the Planner.

The Planner delegates implementation to the Developer.

The Planner delegates validation to the Tester.

The Developer does not independently delegate work.

The Tester does not independently delegate work.

When an agent encounters work outside its responsibility, it must escalate rather than silently taking ownership.

---

# Escalation Rules

## Requirement Problem

If expected behavior is unclear:

```text
Agent
 ↓
Planner
 ↓
Architect
```

Do not invent requirements.

---

## Architectural Problem

If the existing architecture cannot satisfy a requirement:

```text
Agent
 ↓
Planner
 ↓
Architect
```

The Architect decides whether architecture must change.

---

## Implementation Problem

If the problem is within the assigned implementation scope:

```text
Developer
 ↓
fix
```

If it requires an architectural or requirement change:

```text
Developer
 ↓
Planner
 ↓
Architect
```

---

## Testing Failure

If validation fails because of application behavior:

```text
Tester
 ↓
Planner
 ↓
Developer
 ↓
Tester
```

If validation reveals an architectural problem:

```text
Tester
 ↓
Planner
 ↓
Architect
```

If validation reveals requirement ambiguity:

```text
Tester
 ↓
Planner
 ↓
Architect
```

---

# Status Management

`docs/context/status.md` represents the current operational state.

The Planner is the primary owner.

Typical lifecycle:

```text
PLANNING
   ↓
IMPLEMENTATION
   ↓
TESTING
   ↓
COMPLETE
```

Failure:

```text
TESTING
   ↓
FAILED
   ↓
IMPLEMENTATION
   ↓
TESTING
```

Blocker:

```text
IMPLEMENTATION
   ↓
BLOCKED
```

Do not mark work COMPLETE when required validation has not passed.

Do not use `status.md` as a historical activity log.

---

# Token Optimization

Context efficiency is a project requirement.

Agents MUST:

* Prefer targeted searches.
* Read only relevant files.
* Read only relevant sections.
* Avoid loading all context by default.
* Avoid loading the entire repository.
* Reuse persistent context.
* Avoid rediscovering documented decisions.
* Avoid repeating information between agents.
* Pass focused task context.
* Keep reports concise.
* Avoid reproducing large logs.
* Avoid unnecessary test execution.
* Avoid redundant verification.
* Avoid unnecessary documentation.
* Avoid reopening unchanged files without a reason.

Use the smallest amount of context required to make a correct decision.

---

# Repository Investigation

Before reading large files or directories:

1. Determine what information is required.
2. Search for relevant files, symbols, or sections.
3. Read only the required content.
4. Follow dependencies only when necessary.
5. Stop once sufficient confidence is achieved.

Do not scan the entire repository without a specific reason.

---

# Engineering Principles

Prefer:

* Simplicity.
* Existing project conventions.
* Minimal changes.
* Clear separation of responsibilities.
* Maintainability.
* Testability.
* Incremental implementation.
* Reuse of existing abstractions.
* Explicit decisions.
* Focused changes.

Avoid:

* Unnecessary abstractions.
* Premature optimization.
* Unrequested refactoring.
* Unnecessary dependencies.
* Large changes without justification.
* Duplicate implementations.
* Silent architectural changes.
* Speculative features.

---

# Change Management

Architectural changes require Architect involvement.

When an agent discovers that the current architecture cannot satisfy a requirement:

1. Stop the architectural change.
2. Report the problem.
3. Explain the impact.
4. Identify possible alternatives.
5. Escalate to the Architect.
6. Wait for the architectural decision.
7. Update the appropriate context.
8. Re-plan affected work.

Never silently modify the architecture to make implementation easier.

---

# Documentation Rules

Update the appropriate context when persistent project knowledge changes.

```text
requirements.md
→ requirements change

architecture.md
→ architecture changes

decisions.md
→ significant decision is made

implementation.md
→ execution plan changes

testing.md
→ persistent testing knowledge changes

status.md
→ current operational state changes
```

Do not document information merely because it happened.

Document information because it will be useful later.

---

# Definition of Done

A feature or task is complete when:

* Requirements are satisfied.
* Implementation is complete.
* Relevant acceptance criteria are satisfied.
* Required validation has passed.
* No known critical regression remains.
* Required architectural documentation is updated.
* Required persistent context is updated.

The Tester provides validation evidence.

The Planner determines execution completion.

The Architect makes the final project-level determination when appropriate.

---

# Final Authority

The Architect has final authority over:

* Requirements.
* Architecture.
* Significant technical decisions.
* Scope.
* Architectural conflicts.

The Planner has authority over:

* Task decomposition.
* Execution order.
* Development coordination.
* Operational status.

The Developer has authority over:

* Implementation within the approved scope.

The Tester has authority over:

* Validation methodology.
* Test execution.
* Validation results.

No agent may silently override another agent's responsibility.
